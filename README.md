Hello world !
My name is mils and I would like to learn python and javascript, but I guess I should start with one first. I think python is more fun and powerful, but any recomendations on which one to choose first it will be really appreciated.

My hobbies are cooking and spending time with my wife and daughter, however on my litte spare time I would like to learn programing.

See you around!
